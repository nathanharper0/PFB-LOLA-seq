# Calling Peaks
# input file
Now that we have the number of reads (read depth) at each coordinate in the genome, we have to define
what a signal peak is, and where they are, so that we can then look for the closest genomic elements
using another bedtools function. 
# what is a peak
Given we are only interested in open chromatin, and ATAC seq peaks should be relatively sparse, we need to set a threshold depth at which we call something a peak, and below that is noise. We will use this value in the peak calling algorithm. We also arent interested in short peaks fluctuating over and under this threshold, so we perform a filtering step to trash peaks with lengths shorter than 100:
Read depth distribution:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
data=pd.read_csv('/Users/pfb2024/Downloads/MA8_genome_cov_bg.txt',sep='\t',header=None)
data.hist(column=3,range=[0,100],bins=50)
plt.axvline(x=20, color = 'red')
plt.title('counts')
!(PFB-LOLA-seq/generatingfiles/callpeaksfigs/histogramofdepths_ATACseq.png)
```
Peak length distribution (before filtering):
```
data2=pd.read_csv('/Users/pfb2024/Lola-seq/ma8_test_bg.txt',sep='\t',header=None) #unfiltered peaks
data2['length']=data2[2]-data2[1] #calculate length
data2.hist(column='length',range=[0,1000],bins=50)
plt.axvline(x=100, color = 'red')
!(histogramofpeaklengths.png)
```
# Peak calling script
```
#!usr/bin/env python3

import sys

inputfile=sys.argv[1]
outputfile=sys.argv[2]
peaks=[]

#ensure both arguments are present, else exit
if len(sys.argv) != 3:
    print(f'Usage: {sys.argv[0]} <input file name> <output file name>')
    exit(1)

#input file format looks like:
#'Chromosome' \t nt coordinate startstreak \t nt coordinate endstreak \t ATAC read count depth
with open(inputfile,'r') as file: #open input file
    in_peak=False #are we in a peak or not? start false
    for line in file:
        line=line.rstrip()
        base=line.split('\t') #split into list: ['chromosome',coordinate,count]
        if int(base[3]) > 19 and in_peak == False: #if count is 20 or more and we are out of a peak:
            in_peak=True #change to in peak
            start_coord=int(base[1]) #remember start of peak coordinate
        if int(base[3]) <= 19 and in_peak == True: #if count is less than 20 and we are in a peak:
            in_peak = False #we are no longer in the peak
            end_coord=int(base[1]) #remember end of peak coordinate
            peaks.append([base[0],start_coord,end_coord]) #add the peak to list of peaks ['chr1',startcoord,endcoord]

#filter out short peaks (100 or less bases)
filtered_peaks=[]
for peak in peaks:
    if peak[2]-peak[1] > 99: #if peak is 100 or more nts:
        filtered_peaks.append(peak) #add to filtered peaks list
    else: #skip if not
        continue
#write output file tsv
with open(outputfile,'w') as output:
    for peak in filtered_peaks:
        output.write(f'{peak[0]}\t{peak[1]}\t{peak[2]}\n')
output.close()
```
Now we can pass output to bedtools assignClosest to get nearest genomic features for the peaks.


# nb
when we calculated depth, we were using bedtools GenomeCov -bg. To more accurately look at this distribution on a per base basis for the entire genome:
```
newdepth={} #{[depthcount:occurences in genome]}
with open('/Users/pfb2024/Downloads/MA8_genome_cov_bg.txt','r') as genomecor:
    for line in genomecor:
        line=line.rstrip()
        values=line.split('\t')
        if int(values[3]) in newdepth: #if depthcount already appears in dictionary
            newdepth[int(values[3])]+=int(values[2])-int(values[1]) #add length of occurences
        else:
            newdepth[int(values[3])]=int(values[2])-int(values[1]) #if not add to it and set as length
newdepths=pd.DataFrame(newdepth.items())
sortednewdepths=newdepths.sort_values(by=0)

sortednewdepths.plot.scatter(0,1,loglog=True)
plt.title('depth per nt')
plt.xlabel('log(depth)')
plt.ylabel('log(# occurrences)')
plt.axvline(x=20, color = 'red')
plt.axvline(x=200, color = 'green')
!(depthpernt_ATACseq.png)
```
perhaps we could increase the depth threshold for a peak to 200 or so (green) from 20 (red)
